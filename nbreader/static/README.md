Audible support to support notebook activity.

Keyboard shortcuts for use in (command mode / edit mode):

- background hum when kernel busy;
- identify command / edit mode (Ctrl-Shift-M / Ctrl-Shift-M);
- the mode is annoucned when you click in a cell but it seems erratic? maybe better to speak the type of cell and which one?
- identify cell location (Shift-G / Ctrl-Shift-G); eg "cell number 4 of 45"; [could maybe identify code or markdown cell?];
- read cell contents (Shift-R / Ctrl-Shift-R) [identifies cell type and number of lines; lines don't seem to be read correctly? Seems like one line at a time is read and things queue up somewhere?]
